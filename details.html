                    Holo is a powerful wolf deity who is revered in the small town of Pasloe for blessing the annual harvest. 
                    Yet as years go by and the villagers become more self-sufficient, 
                    Holo has been reduced to a mere folktale. 
                    When a traveling merchant named Kraft Lawrence stops at the settlement, 
                    Holo offers to become his business partner if he takes her to her northern home of Yoitsu. 
                    The savvy trader recognizes Holo's unusual ability to evaluate a person's character and accepts her proposition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now in the possession of both sharp bargaining skills and a charismatic negotiator, Lawrence inches closer to his goal of opening his own shop. 
                    However, as Lawrence travels the countryside with Holo in search of economic opportunities, 
                    he begins to realize that his aspirations are slowly morphing into something unexpected.

                <dt>Kraft Lawrence (<span lang="ja">クラフト・ロレンス</span>, Kurafuto Rorensu)</dt>
                <dd>
                    Kraft Lawrence, who chiefly goes by 'Lawrence', 
                    is a 25-year-old traveling merchant who goes from town to town 
                    buying and selling various things in order to make a living. 
                    When he was twelve, he became an apprentice to a merchant relative, 
                    and set out on his own at eighteen. 
                    His goal in life is to gather enough money to start his own shop, 
                    and he has already been traveling for seven years while gaining experience 
                    in the trade. He meets Holo one night and eventually agrees to her traveling with him. 
                    She helps him by providing her wisdom which helps to increase his profits 
                    and get him out of jams. As the series progresses, both Lawrence and Holo demonstrate a growing affection toward each other. 
                    Although Lawrence rarely shows different facial expressions, 
                    he truly cares for Holo. He shows his affection through his actions, 
                    such as when Holo gets captured by the Church and Lawrence completely panics.

                    Holo is a wolf harvest deity originally from a place in the north known as Yoitsu, 
                    which draws parallels to the legendary land of Hyperborea. 
                    She made a promise with inhabitants from a town called Pasloe 
                    that she would ensure the town would have good wheat harvests year after year. 
                    However, as time went on, the townspeople slowly started to forsake Holo, 
                    regarding her as unnecessary, and resented the occasional bad harvests 
                    that Holo told Lawrence were necessary to rest the land. 
                    As such, Holo escapes from town in Lawrence's wagon and started traveling 
                    with him to see how much the world has changed since she has been in Pasloe. 
                    Holo has chosen the form of a 15-year old girl, 
                    though she still retains her 
                    large white-tipped wolf tail, ears, and two sharp fangs. 
                    At times she can produce an ear-shattering howl. 
                    Her true form is that of a very large wolf which many people feared. 
                    In the anime she as a wolf looks to 
                    be about 30 feet high from the ground to her shoulders in 
                    episode 1, and about 10 feet high in the sewer in episode 6. 
                    In the novels she is large enough to carry Lawrence like a horse, 
                    and she can easily leap the walls of Ruvinheigen, 
                    but is small enough to fit in Hans Remelio's office with Remelio and Lawrence. 
                    In human form, she has a peculiar way of speaking, 
                    modeled after that of the oiran high-class courtesans. 
                    She is able to speak to humans as a wolf. 
                    Holo is fond of delicious food and alcohol, 
                    but she always loves something new in each novel. 
                    In volume 1 it is apples. In volume 2 it is apples preserved in honey. 
                    In volume 3 it is eel (i.e. lamprey). 
                    She takes pride in her tail and takes special care of it, 
                    constantly combing and maintaining it. In the novel, volume 1, page 65, 
                    it is described as hanging past the back of her knees. 
                    In the anime it is longer and reaches nearly to her ankles.

                    Holo refers to herself as "Holo The Wise Wolf" 
                    (<span lang="ja">ヨイツの賢狼</span>, Yoitsu no Kenrō, Wise Wolf of Yoitsu). 
                    She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, 
                    though due to her isolation for hundreds of years in Pasloe, 
                    she gradually feels very lonely, 
                    and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself. 
                    She relies on Lawrence for company as she fears loneliness, 
                    which is something that Lawrence is very aware of and tries to comfort her in 
                    his own way. 
                    Holo is also very aware of the different time spans that she and Lawrence have, 
                    as a human lifespan is like a blink of an eye for her kind. 
                    Holo is quite scared of that fact, 
                    but hides it with jokes. 
                    Although she jokes about her affections for Lawrence at first, 
                    she slowly but surely falls in love with him. 
                    At the end of the series, 
                    Holo settles down with Lawrence and they have a daughter, 
                    Myuri, who inherits her mother's traits and is the 
                    main character of the sequel light novel Wolf and Parchment.
